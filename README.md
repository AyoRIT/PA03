Curr files:
1. Graph object: segment, point or trapezoid. Parent class that dictates what each DAG node could be
2. Point
3. Line Segment

TODO
Trapezoid implementation -- discuss functions and attributes of trapezoids
DAG Node -- same as above
DAG -- implement graph class containing DAG nodes. An instance of this might take in a list if segments as an argument and then compute the DAG
